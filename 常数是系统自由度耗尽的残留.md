常数，是系统耗尽自由度后的残余证词

常数并不生成结构。
它出现得太晚，晚到一切生成已经完成，一切选择已经被消耗。

在任何一个可递归、可约束的系统中，最初存在的不是常数，甚至不是数，而是区分、规则与允许重复的操作。结构在重复中展开，自由度在一致性要求下被逐步压缩。等价被识别，差异被消除，路径被合并。系统并非主动追求简化，而是为了继续存在，不得不放弃那些不再产生差别的选择。

当这一过程推进到极限，系统面临三种可能的命运：
它可能崩塌为矛盾；
可能退化为平凡；
或者，在完全失去选择权之后，仍然保持最低限度的一致性。

若第三种情况成立，系统必须留下某种东西，以证明它尚未自毁。

留下来的，往往是一个常数。

这个常数不是被定义出来的，也不是被选中的。它不是参数，因为已经没有可调空间；不是结构，因为结构已被压缩到零维；也不是解释，因为解释在此之前就已失效。它只是一个结果――一个在所有自由度被杀死之后，仍然拒绝消失的量。

因此，常数不是系统的语言，而是系统的证词。
它不说明“为什么如此”，只表明“除此之外，已无他物”。

在数学中，这样的证词表现为不可规避的常数；在物理中，表现为临界指数与守恒量；在学习系统中，表现为不可再优化的阈值或稳定率。它们的共同点不在于形式，而在于出现的时刻：它们都出现在生成终止之后，而非生成之中。

问题不在于常数的存在，而在于使用方式。
当常数被误当前提，当残余被当作原因，生成便被反向替代，自由度被人为冻结。系统并非自然走到终点，而是被提前终止。

正确的使用方式恰恰相反：
常数只能作为终态的标记，而不能作为生成的指令；
只能在特定尺度下成立，而不能被继承为跨尺度真理；
只能在其生成路径仍然可被追溯时被使用，而不能在路径被遗忘后继续统治系统。

常数不是世界的起点。
它是世界在被剥夺一切可选性之后，
唯一还能留下的回答。

在常数之后，系统不再拥有解释的自由，
只剩下对自身终止方式的责任。

Constants Are the Residual Testimony of a System After Its Degrees of Freedom Are Exhausted

A constant does not generate structure.
It appears too late―so late that all generation has already been completed, all choices already consumed.

In any system that is recursive and constrainable, what exists at the beginning is not a constant, not even a number, but distinctions, rules, and operations that are permitted to repeat. Structure unfolds through repetition; degrees of freedom are progressively compressed under the demand for consistency. Equivalences are identified, differences eliminated, paths merged. The system does not actively seek simplification; rather, in order to continue existing, it is forced to abandon those choices that no longer produce distinction.

When this process advances to its limit, the system faces three possible fates:
it may collapse into contradiction;
it may degenerate into triviality;
or, having completely lost the ability to choose, it may still retain the minimum coherence required to persist.

If the third case holds, the system must leave something behind, as proof that it has not annihilated itself.

What remains is often a constant.

This constant is neither defined nor selected. It is not a parameter, because there is no adjustable space left; not a structure, because structure has been compressed to zero dimension; not an explanation, because explanation failed earlier in the process. It is merely a result―something that, after all degrees of freedom have been extinguished, still refuses to disappear.

Thus, a constant is not the language of a system, but its testimony.
It does not explain why things are so; it only states that there is nothing left besides this.

In mathematics, such testimony appears as inescapable constants; in physics, as critical exponents or conserved quantities; in learning systems, as irreducible thresholds or stable rates. Their commonality lies not in form, but in timing: they all appear after generation has terminated, not during generation itself.

The problem is not the existence of constants, but how they are used.
When a constant is mistaken for a premise, when a residue is treated as a cause, generation is reversed, and degrees of freedom are artificially frozen. The system does not naturally arrive at its endpoint; it is prematurely terminated.

The correct use is precisely the opposite:
a constant may only serve as a marker of an end state, never as an instruction for generation;
it may hold only at a specific scale, never be inherited as a cross-scale truth;
it may be used only while its generative path remains traceable, never to rule once that path has been forgotten.

A constant is not the beginning of the world.
It is what remains after the world has been stripped of every possible alternative―
the only answer still capable of being left behind.

After the constant, the system no longer possesses the freedom to explain;
it is left only with responsibility for the manner of its own termination.
